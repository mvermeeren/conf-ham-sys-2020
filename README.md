Support code for 
"Structure preserving discretization of time-reparameterized Hamiltonian systems with application to nonholonomic mechanics" 
by Luis Garc√≠a Naranjo and Mats Vermeeren

There are two main files corresponding to different aspects of the paper:
* Modified Lagrangian.ipynb (runs in SageMath 8.1) implements the symbolic calculation of modified quantities.
* nonholonomic_particle.ipynb (runs in Python 3) implements numerical experiments on the nonholonomic particle.
